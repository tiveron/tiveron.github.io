description: A little bit about the past, the present and the plans for future...
---

I always had the idea to write everything I want on my own blog, but never had the effort that I shoul have to for make this a reallity. So I've just decided that this is the time to stop plan, stop with the excuses and start something that I really like.

I think this will be a great opportunity to share a little bit of my daily, what I'm doing and studying. A chance to practice and improve my english, by writing these posts (so sorry if you find some mistakes here :P).

Talking about work, I currently work as a frontend developer of a great [bank](https://www.itau.com.br) here in brazil. I also worked as frontend developer for a long time before (more than 10 years from now) and also had a lot of contact with backend languages/frameworks too.

Angular, React, Gulp, Grunt, Webpack, SASS, Node.js are some technologies that I'm working with, and there is a lot of others that I want to learn in a near future.

The plan is to write periodicaly about my daily and anything that is part of my day, future plans, ideas, or just something cool.

Please be welcome to send me feedbacks, share opinions, keep in touch =)
